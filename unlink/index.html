    <h2>Unlink</h2>

    <h3>The need</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Unlink</strong> is there for you when you need to find where a shortened link in pointing to without
        browsing it yourself. It will also provide you with a trace of the traversed URLs to reach the final destination
        and the HTTP status with every one. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two things to note, however:
        - Only the first 20 redirections will be reported. This is already an out of the ordinary amount ;
        - Some websites might not behave perfectly, like this one. See example below.
    </p>

    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>
        To <b>resolve a shortened URL</b>, input it in the form below, then click on "Resolve". It will be sent to an
        environment that exists only during the execution of your request. This environment will follow the redirections
        by sending HEAD requests successively until the response is not a redirection anymore or too many redirections
        have been resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The URL must be prefixed with the protocol, i.e. <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Is considered a redirection a response containing a <code>Location</code> header and which status code is one of
        the following:
        - 301: Moved Permanently, the classic permanent redirection;
        - 302: Found, the classic temporary redirection;
        - 307: Temporary Redirect, the newer temporary redirection which preserves the HTTP method;
        - 308: Permanent Redirect, the newer permanent redirection which preserves the HTTP method.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the resolution succeded a message should appear in the read-only box below. This message lists the traversed
        URLs and their redirection status, from origin to destination. The last item should represent the final
        destination of the shortened URL.
    </p>
