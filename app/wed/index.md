## Write Every Day
### The need

When was your last writing session? Don't you want to log a little something every day? You could write a novel day
after day, your work log, your life log, your dreams.

**Write Every Day** is an app that handles that "everyday" practice. Nothing you write will ever leave your computer.
About this: please export and backup whatever you write from time to time or you might risk losing it, if it's important
to you.

### How it works

This website creates one blank sheet for you every day and saves it locally in your browser. Text you write is
autosaved. At midnight local time, you are prompted to switch to a new page. The clock being based on your computer, you
may cheat but we don't recommend doing so.

Pages from previous days cannot be written to anymore but you may read them.

Enough said, now make this tool your everyday writing companion!
