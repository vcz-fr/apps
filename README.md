# â–± VCZ Apps

Siplicity-powered tools!

## The motivation
I always have apps ideas and sometimes I am motivated to go through them and make an actual app. Some of them are adaptations of my PHP applications that have been taken down when I decided to leave my old server behind.
In order to put some challenge into the making of these new applications, they will all be stateless, their frontends will be static and fronted by a CDN and their backends will use Functions as a Service like [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

## About forking this repo to tweak the apps
Yes, of course you can! If you like it, you are even encouraged to do so. Please do me two favors:
- Share your ideas by leaving your thoughts in an issue or through the [feedback form](https://query.vcz.fr/icSO7Q). I will gladly come back to you as soon as I can;
- Read the code, just in case some ugly monster is laying around.
