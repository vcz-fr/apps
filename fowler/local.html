    <h3>The need</h3>
    <p>
        Fowler is an encryption and decryption tool using Web cryptography technologies. Its usage of experimental technologies also implies that this tool will only work
        on the latest browser versions and might stop working in the future whenever one of the experimental technologies gets deprecated.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not recommended using this tool for sensitive matters, even though it will run in your environment, even offline.
    </p>

    <h3>Hot it works</h3>
    <p>
        To encrypt a message, input your encryption key and your text in the form below, then click on "Encrypt".
        The key and the message will be locally encrypted. The message will be returned on the readonly box below.
        Clicking that box will automatically select the text for you.
        Do not forget to send <b>both the key <u>and</u> the encrypted message</b> to your recipient. Separately, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To decrypt a message, input the encrypted text and the decryption key that have been sent to you by the sender, then click on "Decrypt".
        The key and the encrypted message locally decrypted. The message will be returned on the readonly box below.
        Clicking that box will automatically select the text for you, even though this should not matter.
