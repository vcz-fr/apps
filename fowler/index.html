    <h2>Fowler</h2>

    <h3>The need</h3>
    <p>
        Fowler is an encryption and decryption tool using Web cryptography technologies. Its usage of experimental technologies also implies that this tool will only work
        on the latest browser versions and might stop working in the future whenever one of the experimental technologies gets deprecated.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not recommended using this tool for sensitive matters, even though an offline version will be presented soon.
    </p>

    <h3>Hot it works</h3>
    <p>
        To <b>encrypt a message</b>, input your encryption key and your text in the form below, then click on "Encrypt".
        The key and the message will be sent to an environment that exists only during the time it takes to encrypt and return your message.
        The encrypted message will be returned on the readonly box below. Clicking that box will automatically select the text for you.
        Do not forget to send <b>both the key <u>and</u> the encrypted message</b> to your recipient. Separately, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To <b>decrypt a message</b>, input the encrypted text and the decryption key that have been sent to you by the sender, then click on "Decrypt".
        The key and the encrypted message will be sent to an environment that exists only during the time it takes to decrypt and return your message.
        The decrypted message will be returned on the readonly box below. Clicking that box will automatically select the text for you, even though this should not matter.
