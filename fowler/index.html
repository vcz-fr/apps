    <h2>Fowler</h2>

    <h3>The need</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Fowler</strong> is an encryption and decryption tool using Web cryptography technologies. Its usage of
        experimental technologies also implies that this tool will only work
        on the latest browser versions and might stop working in the future whenever one of the experimental
        technologies gets deprecated.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is not recommended using this tool for sensitive matters, even though it will run in your environment, even
        offline. The encryption and decryption algorithms are public, which means that anyone with sufficient computing
        power can decrypt your messages, provided they find the key.
    </p>

    <p>
        This also applies to the <a href="online">online version</a>; you will send data to a system I developed and
        would thus need to trust me and the company that hosts the service. However, decrypting the data is more
        difficult as it requires guessing the key parts of the algorithm.

    <h3>Hot it works</h3>
    <p>
        To <b>encrypt a message</b>, input your encryption key and your text in the form below, then click on "Encrypt".
        The key and the message will be locally encrypted. The message will be returned on the readonly box below.
        Clicking that box will automatically select the text for you.
        Do not forget to send <b>both the key <u>and</u> the encrypted message</b> to your recipient. Separately, if
        possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To <b>decrypt a message</b>, input the encrypted text and the decryption key that have been sent to you by the sender,
        then click on "Decrypt".
        The key and the encrypted message locally decrypted. The message will be returned on the readonly box below.
        Clicking that box will automatically select the text for you, even though this should not matter.
