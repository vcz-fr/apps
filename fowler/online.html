    <h2>Fowler</h2>

    <h3>The need</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Fowler</strong> is an encryption and decryption tool using Web cryptography technologies. Its usage of
        experimental technologies also implies that this tool will only work
        on the latest browser versions and might stop working in the future whenever one of the experimental
        technologies gets deprecated.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not recommended using this tool for sensitive matters as this interface exchanges your texts with an
        application I host online, i.e. you would need to trust me and my service provider. Not only that but it is
        impossible to guarantee messages cannot be decrypted outside of the application.
    </p>

    <h3>Hot it works</h3>
    <p>
        To <b>encrypt a message</b>, input your encryption key and your text in the form below, then click on "Encrypt".
        The key and the message will be sent to an environment that exists only during the time it takes to encrypt and
        return your message.
        The encrypted message will be returned on the readonly box below. Clicking that box will automatically select
        the text for you.
        Do not forget to send <b>both the key <u>and</u> the encrypted message</b> to your recipient. Separately, if
        possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        To <b>decrypt a message</b>, input the encrypted text and the decryption key that have been sent to you by the
        sender, then click on "Decrypt".
        The key and the encrypted message will be sent to an environment that exists only during the time it takes to
        decrypt and return your message.
        The decrypted message will be returned on the readonly box below. Clicking that box will automatically select
        the text for you, even though this should not matter.
