    <h2>Apps: simple yet powerful!</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, Vincenzo <b>Scalzi</b> here!
    </p>
    <p>
        Have you ever needed an app that just does one simple thing? Me too!
        Well, here is my contribution with hopefully exclusive apps and an oath: no added telemetry from my side!
    </p>
    <p>
        My challenge: offer stateless apps hosted on minimalistic environments. No server to manage, infinitely scalable and extreme performance!
        How does it work? Like my <a href="https://vcz.fr">personal website</a> and my <a href="https://meetups.vcz.fr">Meetup notes</a>,
        this site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="nofollow">GitHub Pages</a>, uses
        <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> to generate content and is delivered to you by
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare</a>!
        The difference is that it relies on <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare Workers</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you like what you saw, do not forget to <a href="https://query.vcz.fr/icSO7Q">leave some feedback</a> so that I can make the apps better.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a nice visit!
