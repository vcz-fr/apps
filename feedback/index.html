    <h2>Feedback</h2>

    <h3>The need</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Feedback</strong> is a tool that enables you to leave feedback to content I participated in. The
        feedback form has been designed for simplicity: an application identifier and your message! All feedback will be
        read, that is a promise!
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not recommended using this tool to send sensitive data as it will be exchanged with two third party
        service providers. If you need to exchange sensitive info, please send the necessary information to proceed
        (email and PGP key).
    </p>

    <h3>Hot it works</h3>
    <p>
        To <b>send your feedback</b>, input your application identifier and your text in the form below, then
        click on "Send". Both will be sent to an environment that exists only during the execution of your request.
        Then, provided the identifier leads to an actual application, the message will then be forwarded to its
        corresponding topic. It is then up to me to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the process succeded a message should appear in the readonly box below.
